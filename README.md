# DecisionMap

**A practical protocol for using AI to map complex business and product decisions.**

DecisionMap is a protocol + prompt toolkit, not a SaaS product and not a new AI model.

It is a structured way to think through decisions where there is no single correct answer, only trade-offs under uncertainty.

---

## What it is

DecisionMap helps you turn messy, high-stakes business, product, market, and marketing situations into a **map of strategic options**.

It is especially useful when the problem is not lack of intelligence, but a fragmented or distorted picture of reality.

Instead of asking:
> “What should we do?”

it reframes the problem as:
> “What are our real options, and what does each of them cost?”

Each option is mapped by:
- expected upside
- cost (money, time, reputation, risk)
- required resources
- likely reactions from competitors, customers, or partners
- short / mid / long-term effects
- assumptions
- breakpoints (where it fails)
- signals to monitor

The core output is not a final answer.

It is a **working strategic hypothesis**, with visible trade-offs.

---

## What it is not

DecisionMap is not:
- a chatbot that gives advice
- a prediction engine
- a replacement for decision-makers
- a “smart agent” that thinks for you

It does not:
- guarantee outcomes
- remove uncertainty
- make decisions on your behalf

And it is intentionally out of scope for:
- military or political conflict
- legal or medical advice
- financial investment decisions
- M&A, layoffs, or HR restructuring

---

## When to use it

Use DecisionMap when:
- you have multiple plausible strategies and no clear winner
- the decision involves trade-offs, not right vs wrong
- competitors or external reactions matter
- you feel stuck because the picture is unclear

---

## How it differs from a normal AI chat

Many AI chats jump from context to a clean recommendation too quickly.

DecisionMap forces a disciplined process:
1. clarify the problem
2. separate facts, assumptions, interpretations, and unknowns
3. ask only questions that can change the strategy map
4. build multiple realistic strategies
5. compare trade-offs, resources, risks, and breakpoints
6. pressure-test shortlisted options
7. produce a decision record and working hypothesis

This is slower, but better aligned with real strategic decisions.

## Usage

For a full copy-paste workflow with any LLM, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## Quick start (manual)

You don’t need any app.

1. Set the system prompt from `prompts/system_prompt.md`
2. Run `01_intake.md` with your situation
3. Answer `02_clarifying_questions.md`
4. Generate options via `03_strategy_map.md`
5. Deep dive with `04_deep_dive.md`
6. Finalize with `05_decision_summary.md`

Optional: track updates using `schemas/cascade_log.schema.json`.

For the full step-by-step version, use [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## Privacy

DecisionMap does not require storing data.

However:
- most hosted LLM APIs process data externally
- your input may be processed by third-party providers

For sensitive work:
- anonymize names, companies, exact financials, customer data, and internal documents
- or run in a local model / approved internal environment

---

## Future direction (optional)

Future versions may include:
- project mode
- cascade logs for long-running decisions
- structured memory of decisions, assumptions, signals, outcomes, and revisions

But the core value is already here:
- options, not answers
- working hypothesis, not final truth
- clarity under uncertainty
